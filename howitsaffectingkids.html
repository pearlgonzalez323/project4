<h2 style="color:green;">Todays kids are so caught up in the idea of growing up fast. Theres no longer a childhood to have theyre influenced by being introduced to the idea of social media at such a young age thet they begin to entertain the idea of becoming the role models they look up to in the media.
By being so easily manipulated by these ideas everything else becomes liess intersting and we lose the moments that are meant to be looked back at, we lose their childhood.</h2>
